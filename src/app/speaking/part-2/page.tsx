      "Last summer, I was traveling to Barcelona with my best friend for a week-long vacation. We had booked flights and accommodation months in advance.

The airline provided vouchers for food, but the experience was quite stressful. If I were to do it differently, I'd probably book direct flights and always have travel insurance to cover unexpected delays.",
