  text: `I'd like to talk about my grandmother, who has been a tremendous source of inspiration throughout my life. She's 78 years old now, and I've known her since childhood, obviously, as she's my mother's mother.

My grandmother has led quite a remarkable life. During her younger years, she worked as a nurse in our local hospital while raising four children, which was quite challenging back then. Even after retirement, she continues to volunteer at a community center, helping elderly people who are less fortunate than herself.

What makes her so inspiring to me is her incredible resilience and positive attitude. She's faced numerous hardships in her life, including the loss of my grandfather ten years ago, but she's never let these difficulties defeat her spirit. Instead, she's always maintained this amazing optimism and continues to help others despite her own challenges.

She's also taught me the value of hard work and compassion. Whenever I visit her, I see how she treats everyone with such kindness and respect, regardless of their background. She has this wonderful ability to make everyone feel welcome and valued, which I really admire and try to emulate in my own life.

Her strength and wisdom have shaped who I am today, and whenever I face difficulties, I think of her example and it gives me the courage to keep going.`,
